Jumping Enemy has been updated - now splits into smaller/faster enemies -- pls show wojtek :)

WALL ENEMY

Wall enemy saved as prefab
Climbable pillar also prefab

When Pillar and enemy are placed, populate waypoints in "wall enemy" script (incl. on prefab)
with waypoints (WP1, WP2 etc) from pillar, in order (WP1 in slot 0). Waypoints have been made as visible cubes for ease only.

Also fill in player in player gameObject slot (these wont save properly with the prefab idk).

Have also included Shoot and Projectile scripts that can be place on any object.
Objects with Shoot script must have spawn point for instantiation.
Projectiles must have rigidbody (requirement incl. in script).

Currently Shoot script instatiates indefinitely -- this needs fixed (will do later).
